poem = """Idioglossia
beneath the sun’s warm, golden sigh, we stand
where earth and sea embrace in whispered hush,
immersive waves compose a lullaby
in tongues of salt and foam, a sacred rush.
roses bloom along the shore’s soft curve,
their petals pure as dawn’s first gentle breath,
each bloom a vow the heart alone can serve
in idioglossia—our secret, hallowed depth.
the sea unfurls its canvas, vast and wide,
the sun ignites each ripple into flame;
we speak in colors only souls confide,
and every word we utter is the same.
so let us wander where the water gleams,
our voices weaving dreams beneath the sun—
in that pure space beyond our waking dreams,
our private language lives, in us, as one
Paloma Negra
a solitary shadow on sunlit stones,
a paloma negra—midnight’s gentle wing—
she drifts between the world’s forgotten tones,
and carries every whispered hope within.
her feathers hold the hush of starless nights,
yet flash with midnight’s secret, silken grace;
she perches where the city’s heartbeat lights
the lonely corners of this crowded place.
in her dark eyes, a mirror of the skies,
you glimpse the depth of time’s unspoken vow;
each flutter plants a spark where wonder lies,
and bids the weary heart to breathe, somehow.
oh, paloma negra—soft as twilight’s hum—
in your quiet flight, belief and beauty come."""
